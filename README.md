# üß† Algorithm Exercises ‚Äì Java Projects

Welcome to my collection of algorithmic mini-projects in Java!  
These beginner-to-intermediate level projects are designed to help me and others strengthen our programming logic, problem-solving abilities, and hands-on Java skills through real-world inspired scenarios.

## üìö Project List

### 1. Investment Earnings  
Tracks the change in stock price after each trading day. The user enters a buying price and closing prices; earnings are calculated until a negative price is entered.

### 2. Budget Allocation  
Simulates budget planning by distributing a given amount across different expenses based on user-defined proportions. Stops if the total exceeds 100%.

### 3. Average Stock Price  
Calculates the average cost per share after multiple transactions using a custom `Stock` class.

### 4. Draw Staircases  
Generates a staircase pattern using nested for-loops. Step width and height are user-defined.

### 5. Student Selection  
Stores student names and ages using arrays. Filters and displays students above a specified age.

### 6. Time Adder  
Adds two time values, handling overflow of seconds, minutes, and hours with conditional logic.

### 7. GPA Calculator  
Calculates a student's Grade Point Average using `switch-case`. Subjects and grades are stored in a student object.


### 9. Vehicle Insurance  
Determines insurance premium based on vehicle type using nested `switch-case` structures.

### 10. Word Counter  
Counts the number of words in a string by trimming spaces and detecting word boundaries.

### 11. Word Occurrence Counter  
Counts how often a specific word appears in a given string, handling edge positions and spacing.

### 12. Roster Table  
Implements a weekly duty roster using an `ArrayList` of `ArrayLists`, allowing queries for individual schedules.

### 13. Lottery Number Generator  
Generates 6 unique numbers out of 49 and displays them sorted.

### 14. Compare Student Marks  
Compares total marks of two students using the `Comparable` interface and data stored in `ArrayList`.

### 15. Bank Account with Transfer  
Simulates basic bank transactions including balance checks and money transfers between accounts.

### 16. Restaurant Billing System  
Calculates total order cost in a restaurant scenario by creating and querying a `Bill` class instance.

### 17. Matrix Multiplication  
Performs matrix multiplication using 2D arrays and nested loops. Validates dimension compatibility before processing.
