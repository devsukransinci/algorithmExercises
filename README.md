1.project Investment earnings :The example code keeps track of the change in stock price after each trading day. A user enters the buying price and the closing price on subsequent trading days. Then the earnings are evaluated. The process stops when a negative closing price is entered.

2.project Budget allocation: This example demonstrates the budget allocation task. A user inputs the amount available to spend. Then the user inputs the proportions of the amount on each expense item. The expense input can stop if the total proportion exceeds 100%. Finally, the program shows the amount spent on each expense item.

3.project Average stock price : The program evaluates the average cost of the shares after a number of transactions. A Stock class is created, and the methods there can update the average cost of the shares after each transaction.

4.project:Draw staircases :The program draws a staircase pattern. The step width and number of steps are given. Then the program draws the staircase pattern using nested for-loops.

5.project Student selection :The program selects the students above a certain age. It first asks for the number of students. Then you input the names and their age. Finally, the program tells you the student names who are above a certain age.  Arrays are used in the program.

6.project Time adder:The program adds a time to a given time. It handles the issue of carry digits arising from adding seconds, minutes, and hours by using if statements.

7.project Grade point average system :The program evaluates the grade point average of a student object using switch-case command. A student object is created, on which we give the subjects and the corresponding grades. Then we create a method to evaluate the grade point average. 

9.project Vehicle insurance:The program determines the vehicle insurance premium according to the vehicle type. Nested switch-case statements are employed to handle the further classification of vehicles. 

10.project Word counter :The program counts the number of words in a string. It removes the leading and trailing spaces of the received string. Then it searches for the space-character pattern as the indicator of a word.

11.project Word occurrences counter:The program counts the number of occurrences of a word in a given string. It trims the string to remove the leading and trailing spaces. Then it counts the target word at the beginning and at the end, if any. Then it counts the target words surrounded by spaces. 

12.project Roster table:We set up a roster table using an ArrayList of ArrayLists. We also obtain the days of duty for a certain person. To do so, we loop over each element in the sub-ArrayLists.

13.project Lottery number generator : We generate 6 numbers out of 49 numbers. We have to check that a drawn number is not repeating all the previously drawn numbers. We sort the results finally.

14.project Compare student marks : We compare the total marks for two students my implementing the compareTo method given by the Comparable interface. The total marks are obtained by adding the marks stored in the ArrayList elements. 

15.project Bank account with transfer feature : The program simulates a bank account system that allows transfer of money to another account. We also check whether the amount of transfer and withdrawal is allowed. 

16.project :Restaurant billing system:The program simulates a restaurant billing system that allows adding order and finding out the total bill cost. The driver program creates a Bill instance and that instance can return the required quantities.

17.project :Matrix multiplication:We perform matrix multiplication by using 2-dimensional arrays for Java. We make use of 3-level nested for-loops to evaluate each element of the result matrix. We also check for dimension match before performing the multiplication.
